(Working) Title: Breath of Life

The themes are

Lasers
Breath
Random

- Top Down shooter where the diety give a life to human beings. (Raccoon_JS)
-- and enemies are shooting lasers.

more ideas:
diety (from jiegonator)
- gives life to multiple types of lifeforms
- skeleton is just a blank template
- can 'accidentally' create a ghost
-- something she absorbs which affects her breath. And if she isn't careful enough and accidentally absorbs this thing and fires off her breath, she'll create a ghost.
The damage would change the quality of her breath. (Raccoon_JS)
damage by laser.
the damage give the goddess a duration to shoot bad breath.
So, when she gets hit, there is a timeframe that her breath's effect is actually to create ghosts? (jiegonator)
(Raccoon_JS)
yes - unless if there is an item that could heal her and purify her breath.
Left mouse button - Attack
Right mouse button - give life
the flower she resurrected - that could be her healing item.
(jiegonator)
within her 'bad breath' timeframe. let's make her breath uncontrollable
So it's like, the goddess becomes a demoness when hit.
